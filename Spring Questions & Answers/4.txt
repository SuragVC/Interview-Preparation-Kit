Q. What is Dependency Injection ?
	Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in the spring framework where the objects are given their 
dependencies at creation time by some external entity rather than having created or looking for dependent objects
themselves. This process is handled by the Spring IoC container which uses DI to manage components and their 
dependencies to achieve loose coupling between objects.
