Q. How springboot works internally ?
	The entry point of a spring-boot application is a class that contains @SpringBootApplication annotation
and has the main method. @SpringBootApplication annotation is a combination of three annotations.
@ComponentScan is used to scan all the components available on the application.
@EnableAutoConfiguration and @Configuration annotations the springboot application configures the springboot 
application automatically.
Springboot follows the naming convention for dependencies like spring-boot-starter.
