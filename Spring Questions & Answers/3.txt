Q. What is meant by Inversion Of Control in spring ?
	Inversion Of Control (IOC) is a principle in software engineering where the flow of control of a 
system is inverted in comparison to traditional control flow. In the context of the Spring framework, 
IoC refers to the framework's way of managing the lifecycle of components and their dependencies.
	Spring IoC provides this IoC support through dependency injection, enabling developers to focus
on writing the business logic of their applications.
