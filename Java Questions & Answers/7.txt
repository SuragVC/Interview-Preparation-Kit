Q. What is a Just in Time compiler?
	JIT is a component of JRE that improves the performance fo Java applications at run time by compiling 
bytecodes into native machine code. The JIT compiler compiles the bytecodes of a method during run time when
it is called and then caches the compiled code for future calls. This allows for faster execution of code than
would be possible if each time the code was interpreted.
