Q. What is Java?
	Java is a high-level object-oriented programming language used for developing software
and applications. It was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released 
in 1995. Java is known for its "Write once, run anywhere" (WORA) property, meaning code can
be written on one platform and run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. 
It is widely used for developing desktop, web, mobile, and enterprise applications.
