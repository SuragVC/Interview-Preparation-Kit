Q. What is Garbage collection in Java? When it will be executed?
	The garbage collector is a mechanism that is responsible for automatically freeing up
memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program. That helps to prevent 
memory leaks and improve performance.
	The exact timing of garbage collection execution in Java is determined by the JVM and
is dependent on various factors, such as the amount of memory being performed. The JVM 
periodically checks which objects are no longer being used and reclaim the memory occupied 
by those objects. The programmer can explicitly execute the garbage collector using System.gc().
But it won't guarantee the execution of the garbage collector.
