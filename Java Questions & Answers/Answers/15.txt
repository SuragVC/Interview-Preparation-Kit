Q. What is Encapsulation ?
	Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping data and code within a single unit, called an object, in 
object-oriented programming. It provides a secure mechanism for hiding the data and behavior of an object,
making the object's internal state accessible to the outside world, while exposing a well-defined interface 
that allows the outside world to interact with the object in a controlled manner.
