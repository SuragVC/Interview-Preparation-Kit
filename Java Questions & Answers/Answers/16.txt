Q. Is Java a statically or dynamically typed language?
	Java is a statically typed language. This means when declaring a variable in Java we have to specify its 
datatype upfront and in the runtime, we can't change the data type. Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are some
examples of dynamicallyÂ typed languages.
