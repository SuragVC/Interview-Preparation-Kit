Q. What is Polymorphism ?
	Polymorphism is part of OOPs. An object behaving differently in different situations is called polymorphism. 
There are two types of polymorphism, static polymorphism, and dynamic polymorphism.
	Static polymorphism also known as compile-time polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading.
Method overloading means a method with the same name but a different parameter or multiple parameters 
implemented in the same class.
	Dynamic polymorphism also known as runtime polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding.
Method overriding means overriding the methods available in the parent class on the child class.
	Polymorphism can be also achieved through interfaces. Implementing an interface in multiple classes 
and providing a different signature for methods.
