Q. What is class loader?
	The class loader is a component that is present on the JVM. It is responsible for loading Java classes
into the JVM's memory during runtime as needed by the program. Class loading is an important aspect of
Java's Security model, as it allows the JVM to separate and manage the class loaded by different parts of the
program, preventing malicious code from interfering with other parts of the system.
