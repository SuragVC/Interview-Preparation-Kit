Q. What is the flow of a Java application execution?Â 
	 Java code execution goes like this:
	1. The Java source code is written and saved with a .java extension.
	2. The source code is then compiled using the Java Compiler (javac), which converts the code into
	    bytecode, a machine-readable format, and saves it in a .class file.
	3. The bytecode is executed by the Java  Virtual Machine (JVM) which is platform-independent and 
	    converts the bytecode into machine code that can be executed on the target machine.
	4. The JVM loads the class file, verifies the bytecode, and allocates memory for the program.
	5. The JVM will call the main method and executes the main method of the program, which is the
	    entry point for the code execution.
	6. The JVM executes the code line by line, executing any methods or statements as necessary.
	7. The JVM continues to execute the code until it reaches the end of the main method or encounters 
	    an error, at which point it terminates the program.
